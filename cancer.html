                In 2023, an estimated 9,910 children younger than 15 and about
                5,280 teens ages 15 to 19 in the India will be diagnosed with
                cancer. In children under 15, leukemia makes up 28% of all
                childhood cancers diagnosed. The next most common type of
                childhood cancer is brain cancer (26%), followed by lymphoma
                (12%). In teens ages 15 to 19, brain cancer (21%), lymphoma
                (19%), and leukemia (13%) are the most commonly diagnosed
                cancers. Some cancers that are often found in adults are also
                common in teens. For example, thyroid cancer makes up 12% of
                cancer cases in teens, while melanoma makes up 3% of cases in
                this age group.

              A childhood brain or spinal cord tumor is a disease in which

              The brain controls many important body functions. The spinal cord
              connects the brain with nerves in most parts of the body. Brain
              and spinal cord tumors are a common type of childhood cancer. Some
              tumors are benign and some children can be

                <h2 class="text-center headingcard">Screening for Cancer</h2>
                <p>
                  Screening is testing for a disease such as cancer in people
                  who don’t have any symptoms. Childhood cancers are rare, and
                  there are no widely recommended screening tests to look for
                  cancer in children who are not at increased risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Early detection through screening also means faster recovery,
                  less money spent on treatment and better chance of your
                  survival.

              <p>
                Some children have a higher chance of developing a specific type
                of cancer because of certain gene changes they inherit from a
                parent. These children may need careful, regular medical
                check-ups that include special tests to look for early signs of
                cancer.

              <h4>Some Limitations</h4>
              <p>
                Though cancer screening is good to detect cancer in early
                stages, which can help ypu recover quicker and spend less on the
                treatments. But it also comes with some limitations which are as
                follows:
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>False Positive:</strong>Sometimes test results suggest
                you have cancer even though you don't. A false positive can make
                you anxious and stressed because you think you have cancer when
                you don't. It may lead to further testing that is invasive and
                unnecessary to rule out cancer
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong> False Negative: </strong>The test may not detect cancer
                even though it is present. A false negative may mistakenly
                reassure you and let you think you don't have cancer when you
                do. This may lead you to ignore symptoms that indicate the
                presence of cancer, causing a delay in diagnosis and treatment.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong> Over Diagnosis: </strong>
                Some cancers would not necessarily lead to death or decreased
                quality of life. Overdiagnosis is when a test finds cancer that
                would not necessarily lead to death or decreased quality of
                life. Some cancers are slow growing or may never cause problems
                or need treatment. Finding these types of cancer can lead to
                unnecessary treatments that have side effects.

                These 2 procedures are similar and often done at the same time
                to examine the bone marrow, which is the spongy, fatty tissue
                found inside larger bones. Bone marrow has both a solid and a
                liquid part. A bone marrow aspiration removes a sample of the
                fluid with a needle. A <strong>bone marrow biopsy</strong> is
                the removal of a small amount of solid tissue using a needle. A
                pathologist then studies the samples in a lab. A common site for
                a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is the pelvic bone, which is
                located by the hip.

                to look for cancer cells or tumor markers. Tumor markers are

                urine, or body tissues of people with certain kinds of cancer.
                CSF is the fluid that flows around the brain and the spinal

                body using x-rays taken from different angles. A computer then
                combines these pictures into a detailed, 3-dimensional image
                that shows any abnormalities or tumors. A CT scan can also be
                used to measure the tumor’s size.

                An <strong>MRI</strong> uses magnetic fields, not x-rays, to
                produce detailed images of the body. MRI can also be used to
                measure the tumor’s size.

                Positron emission tomography (PET) or PET-CT scan
              </h3>
              <p>
                A <strong>PET scan</strong> is usually combined with a CT scan
                (see above), called a PET-CT scan. However, you may hear your
                doctor refer to this procedure just as a PET scan. A PET scan is
                a way to create pictures of organs and tissues inside the body.
                A small amount of a radioactive sugar substance is injected into
                the patient’s body. This sugar substance is taken up by cells
                that use the most energy. Because cancer tends to use energy
                actively, it absorbs more of the radioactive substance. However,
                the amount of radiation in the substance is too low to be
                harmful to patients. A scanner then detects this substance to
                produce images of the inside of the body.

                is injected into the body and then followed with a special
                camera or x-ray to see where the material goes. These studies
                can find abnormalities in the liver, brain, bones, kidneys, and
                other organs.
